# DeepARTransit
DeepARTransit is a library for de-trending transit light curves.
It contains a Tensorflow implementation of a stacked Long Short-Term Memory network architecture: 
- trained to predict the next step's mean and standard deviation of a gaussian likelihood.
- used for interpolating an inner chunk of the input time-series

Although designed for predicting the flux of transit light curves during transit time, this could more generally be used for
